## Context
Does having a loyalty card status (Star, Nova, Aurora) cause an increase in CLV?

I'm investigating whether attaining a loyalty card status with an airline impacts CLV. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is calculated as the total revenue generated by a customer from flight bookings throughout their membership period. Basically, it represents the expected total revenue from a given customer.

I believe that having a loyalty card increases CLV.
